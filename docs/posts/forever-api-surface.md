# Absent from the Docs, Present in the Client: Mapping WoW Forever's Real API Surface

*Blog post draft — musingsofmy.today. Reference source for the episode.*
*Overlaps `01-FACT-SHEET.md` by design; the prose framing is what matters here.*

---

**WoW: Forever** is a beta client that reports itself as mainline while running
a Classic-era world. That combination breaks the usual assumptions in both
directions: Retail addons find their branches taken and their files missing,
and Classic addons find their APIs deleted.

Everything below was measured on **build 69913, Interface 16001**, in a running
client — by walking the global table, by calling things and recording what came
back, and by opening an auctioneer. Where a measurement contradicts
documentation, the measurement is what is written here.

## Both offline sources are structurally blind

Start here, because it invalidates a lot of otherwise reasonable conclusions.

There are two ways to ask "does this API exist" without launching the game.
Each is blind in a specific way, and the blindness overlaps:

- An **API documentation index** covers the **C** API. FrameXML **Lua** globals
  and tables are not in it.
- A **runtime `_G` dump** typically walks top-level *functions* and `C_*`
  namespaces. Members of plain non-`C_` global *tables* are invisible to it.

Anything Lua-side living inside a global table falls through both.
`Menu.ModifyMenu` is the worked example: documented nowhere, absent from a
function-walking dump, and **present in the client**. A `type()` check found it
in seconds.

So the rule *"absent from the index means it does not exist"* holds only for
the C API. For `Menu`, `UnitPopupMenus`, `UIDropDownMenu_*` and FrameXML
helpers generally, nothing short of an in-client check is authoritative.

## Existence does not imply safety

This is the finding that most changes how you write code for this client.

`C_Housing.GetMaxHouseLevel` access-violates the client. It is also:

- **documented** in the client's own API tables, as a no-argument getter, and
- **present at runtime** — it shows up in the `_G` walk, one of `C_Housing`'s
  63 functions.

So `if C_Foo and C_Foo.Bar then` is a nil-guard, not a crash-guard. The crash
lives *inside* a function that passes every test reachable from Lua. And
`pcall` does not help: it catches Lua errors, not access violations. There is
nothing to test for in advance.

The only mitigation that works is procedural. Print what you are about to call
*before* calling it, so a hard crash leaves the culprit named on screen. Make
the sequence resumable from any step. And never put an unproven call in a save
path — SavedVariables are written by the client at `/reload` or logout, so a
crasher there destroys the data it was supposed to persist.

## Namespace coverage: the two-way gap

```
documented C_ namespaces    277
runtime C_ namespaces       269

documented AND present      250
documented, NOT present      27
present, NOT documented     ~19
```

Both directions matter. Twenty-seven documented namespaces do not exist at
runtime, so calling into them is a nil index. Roughly nineteen exist with no
documentation at all, so their signatures are unknown until you call them —
which, per the previous section, is not risk-free.

## Legacy globals: gone, kept, and undocumented-but-working

**Gone.** `GetItemInfo`, `GetSpellInfo`, `UnitAura`, `GetAddOnMetadata`,
`UnitPVPRank`, `GetPVPRankInfo`, `GetSkillLineInfo`, `GetNumSkillLines`. There
is no Classic PvP rank badge to be had; Forever reworked honor, and
`UnitHonor`, `UnitHonorLevel` and `GetPVPLifetimeStats` exist instead.

**Kept, inconsistently.** `IsSpellKnown` survives while `GetSpellInfo` does
not. Do not infer a pattern; there is not one. Check each name.

**Present in `_G` but undocumented**, and all observed returning clean values:

```
GetGuildInfo("player")  ->  name, rankName, rankIndex, realm
GetProfessions()        ->  prof1, prof2, archaeology, fishing, cooking, firstAid
GetProfessionInfo(i)    ->  name, icon, skill, maxSkill, numAbilities,
                            spellOffset, skillLineID, skillModifier
GetAchievementInfo(id)  ->  all nil
```

`GetProfessionInfo`'s seventh return is the canonical skill-line ID — 165
Leatherworking, 393 Skinning, 356 Fishing — so it is genuinely structured data,
not a display string.

`GetGuildInfo` is worth calling out: `C_GuildInfo` has **39 functions and not
one returns your own guild name or rank**. The undocumented global is the only
path. `GetAchievementInfo` returning all-nil lines up with `C_AchievementInfo`
exposing five stubs: achievements are not a player-facing system here.

## Native serialisation, and what it actually costs

`C_EncodingUtil` is present with all ten functions — CBOR and JSON
serialisation, Deflate/Zlib/Gzip compression, Base64 and hex, and the inverses.
That means **no LibSerialize and no LibDeflate**, which is a real dependency
saving.

Measured on a realistic ~380-byte payload:

```
CBOR      386 B
Deflate   293 B   (-24%)
Base64    392 B   (+34%)
JSON      517 B   (for contrast)

round trip: lossless
chunks:     2 at 240 B
```

The counter-intuitive part: the Base64 output (392 B) is *larger than the CBOR
you started from* (386 B). Compression is not paying for the encoding. It is
paying for the chunk boundary — Base64 of raw CBOR would be about 515 B, which
is three chunks instead of two. At this size, Deflate buys you exactly one
fewer message.

Base64 output is plain ASCII, which matters more than it looks: addon-message
transports reject control characters, so an ASCII-safe payload avoids a whole
class of escaping problem.

## Model widgets: all six work, including the undocumented one

`PlayerModel` is **not** among the 18 documented `FrameAPI*` widget families.
It works anyway.

```
widget            documented 24   legacy camera 15
PlayerModel            24/24            15/15
DressUpModel           24/24            15/15
CinematicModel         24/24            15/15
TabardModel            24/24            15/15
Model                  24/24            15/15
ModelScene              0/24             1/15
```

Five types share an identical surface, and **nothing documented was missing on
any of them**. `ModelScene` carries none of it, which is correct — it is a
scene that hosts actors rather than a model itself, and needs the actor API.

The full legacy camera set is present: `SetCamera`, `SetPosition`, `SetFacing`,
`SetLight`, `SetCustomCamera`, `SetPitch`, `SetViewTranslation`.

Two practical traps. **A hidden model frame will not load geometry** — call
`SetKeepModelOnHide(true)` before `SetUnit`, or `SetUnit` returns `false` with
display ID 0 and you will misdiagnose it as a client limitation. And
**`CanSetUnit` is not a predicate here**: its documented signature lists no
return value, and it returns `nil` for every token including deliberately
invalid ones. Use `SetUnit`'s documented boolean instead.

## The auction house is modern, and that matters for addons

Opening an auctioneer with a passive event recorder running produced this:

```
AUCTION_HOUSE_SHOW                     1
AUCTION_HOUSE_BROWSE_RESULTS_ADDED     3
AUCTION_HOUSE_BROWSE_RESULTS_UPDATED   1
AUCTION_HOUSE_NEW_RESULTS_RECEIVED     4
AUCTION_HOUSE_THROTTLED_MESSAGE_SENT   9
AUCTION_HOUSE_CLOSED                   1

legacy AUCTION_ITEM_LIST_UPDATE etc.   ZERO
```

Browse queries ran and returned results. Nine throttled round-trips completed.
**Not one legacy event fired**, and `C_AuctionHouse` has all 85 functions at
runtime.

For addon authors this settles which code path is correct. Auctionator, for
instance, loads on this client but its AH layer does not — every relevant
bundle is gated to game types that omit `camelot`:

```
Libs_ModernAH      [AllowLoadGameType cata, mists, mainline]
Imports_ModernAH   [AllowLoadGameType cata, mists, mainline]
Assets_ModernAH    [AllowLoadGameType cata, mists, mainline]
Source_ModernAH    [AllowLoadGameType cata, mists, mainline]
Source_Mainline    [AllowLoadGameType mainline]
```

It degrades silently rather than erroring — no Lua errors at all. And because
the client fires modern events exclusively, `Source_ModernAH` is demonstrably
the right bundle; `Source_LegacyAH` would be actively wrong. The toc gating
alone could not have told you that, since `camelot` is missing from both lists.

## Character data has surprises

```
UnitFullName("player")  ->  "Aeldorath Zephrai", "ClassicBetaPvE2"
UnitRace("player")      ->  "Windshaper Skyborne", "Skyborne", 96
```

**Character names contain a space.** Forever has a surname system —
`C_PlayerInfo.ShouldDisplaySurname` exists — so any parsing that splits on
whitespace or assumes a single token will break. This matters for layout and
for whisper targeting.

**New races exist.** Skyborne, race ID 96, is not a Classic race. A
race-to-icon map built from Classic IDs will not cover it.

Also worth knowing: `UnitFullName` is the only name getter that reliably
carries the realm — `UnitName("player")` returned the name with a `nil` realm.
And `C_ClassColor.GetClassColor` takes the *file* name (`"HUNTER"`), not the
localised one.

## Confirmed working, for what it is worth

All eight standard frame templates load: `BackdropTemplate`,
`UIPanelButtonTemplate`, `UIPanelCloseButton`, `InputBoxTemplate`,
`UICheckButtonTemplate`, `UIPanelScrollFrameTemplate`, `OptionsSliderTemplate`,
`TooltipBorderedFrameTemplate`.

`C_ChatInfo` has the full addon-message surface including
`SendAddonMessageLogged`, and prefix registration returns
`Enum.SendAddonMessageResult.Success`. Titles work — 111 exist — though
`GetTitleName` returns a fragment with the name's position implied, so do not
splice a name into it blindly.
